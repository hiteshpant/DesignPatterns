-----------Builder pattern Applicability----------
1- When we need to pass too many parameter in constructor for object creation
2- And Construction process is order dependent.
3- We have diffrent construction process
4- To Note step/recipe should be the same for construction.
4-GOF : Seprates the construction of complex obejct from its representation
so that same construction process can create diffrent representations.
